            have handpicked some of the projects I think are most exciting and
            you can read about my workflow and my considerations for each
            project.

              The first professional project I made was a webpage. The customer
              wanted a simple web application, for massage-booking.

              <p>
                When I started on the project, I had only worked with Java.
                Therefore Java Spring was the go-to framework. <br />
                Firstly I wanted to get a hold of all the logic, and started
                working on the backend stuff. I made the model classes for the
                booking logic and from here I could start working on the
                repository, service and controller classes. I have used
                hibernate for interaction with the database. I created the
                database using GearHost. As I have used hibernate, the
                repository is pretty straight forward and with the help of JPA
                it resulted in very little code. The service classes were basic
                as well. Looking back, I should have probably put some of the
                logic from the controller into the service class. The basics of
                the controller class was quickly implemented as well and could
                start with some of my frontend elements.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                When I created the project I had no previous experience with
                frontend development. The static text and pages were made with
                the help of the bootstrap css framework. I ran into a lot of
                issues when I started on the actual booking system. For this I
                used FullCalendar.io, a full size JavaScript calendar. Most of
                the issues I had were in JS, as I had no prior experience in JS
                at all. I struggled a lot, but eventually I got everything to
                work. I used jQuery Ajax, for making calls to the controller,
                for saving and retrieving bookings from the database to the
                actual calendar.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                The customer also wanted an admin-page for him to make available
                appointments to the calendar. I made a calendar similar to the
                booking-calendar where it is possible to create, delete, and
                watch appointments. I used Spring Security to make the
                admin-page, so that it can be accessed only with a username and
                password, encrypted and stored in the database.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                When I was done with the actual webpage I thought it would be
                easy and that I could deploy it within hours. That was not the
                case. The webpage is hosted from an EC2 instance on AWS. The
                webpage was quickly online, but only from the IP-address. From
                the web-hotels DNS-configurations I could point the domain-name
                to the IP.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Now the webpage was online on the right domain... followed by
                :8080, and not secure. It took me a couple of days to learn how
                to use certbot and to get the SSL certificate and set up the
                properties correctly. Eventually I got everything configured
                correctly, and the webpage was, and still is up and running on
                port 443 with a LetsEncrypt Certificate. I have not shared the
                source code for this project, as it is private. I am very open
                to showing it and answering questions on request.
