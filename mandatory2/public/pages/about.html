            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">My passion for Computer Science</h2>

            <br />
            <p>
              My general interest in computers have always been a part of me,
              from when I was young and started playing games on a computer,
              like many other young ones. I have always wondered just how
              computers worked and it was kind of a mystery to me as a kid. It
              seemed like magic to me, that you could simply click some buttons
              and something great happend in front of you. So learning about the
              mystery of computers and even how to program your own software is
              very exciting to me.
            </p>

            <p>
              I have had a great drive towards many goals in my life. When I
              started at KEA I could really feel that I had chosen the right
              education. In my first semester I thought that I would never learn
              to code because of the steep learning curve. But once I had
              changed my mindset towards more logical and abstract thinking,
              things took off and everything started to click into place, and
              learning to program seemed way easier for me to comprehend.

              I recently landed a job as a tutor on my school, where I help my
              fellow students, mainly the first and second semester students. I
              love to help others, where I can. And helping people in computer
              science is especially satisfying, as you get to help other people
              get that eureka-kind-of-moment, where everything comes together. I
              have also helped students from my own class in my spare time, and
              I enjoy that aswell. For me helping others, is at least as
              beneficial for me, as the student I am helping. As I get to think
              more about certain methods and datatypes, I normally would not
              work with as much.

            <p>
              As a person, I am very detail oriented and determined. I do not
              stop working on a problem before it is solved. And when I put my
              mind to something, I have to do it all the way. This comes into
              play, when i code. I like to code and learn for many hours at a
              time, because "Just 10 min of coding" quickly turns into me
              reading about something new, that I did not knew i needed to know
              about, before i sat down and started typing. If i work with
              problems I know little or nothing about, I don't quit. I will find
              a way to solve the problem, even if I have to use tools, I have
              never used before. With google and stackoverflow, you can come a
              long way on your own.

            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">About me</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              Before I started learning about coding and computers, I have spend
              a great amount of time sailing to various places all over the
              world, as I've been employeed in the Royal Danish Navy. I have
              sailied a lot in the north and in the mediterranean sea, once on a
              NATO-mission. I had a great experience working in the Navy where I
              learned a lot. Both about sailing of course, but also I learned a
              lot about how every part of a machine has it's unique function.
              Every sailor aboard have some responsibility, that is equally
              important. This is a good mindset to have, when working on future
              projects in group-oriented settings, and in larger companies in
              general. The chain is not stronger than it's weakest link.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              For now, my passion for the sea is put on the shelf and my mindset
              is 100% set towards becomming a greater skilled developer.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I like to use a lot of my sparetime on coding. But that is of
              course not my only hobby. I spend many hours a week working out. I
              love to run, workout in the gym and to swim. I have been working
              out regularly for many years and it is a great way for me to get
              away from the screen and to clear my mind. During the lockdown, I
              have been running more that usual, because of the closed gyms and
              i recently ran a half-marathon. My next goal is to run a marathon
              before the winter of 2021. One of my most recent hobbies is
              mountainbiking, which I took up last year. I do this with my
              friends in the spring and summer. I really enjoy the adrenelin and
              kick you get from riding the trails.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              When i am not working on my computer, or working out, i like to
              spend time with friends and family. I love to make dinner with my
              girlfriend or have a night out with her or my friends. I
              appriciate a beer or two in the friday bar. I also enjoy a night
              in, with movies and hygge.
