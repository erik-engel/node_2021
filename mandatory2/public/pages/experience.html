              Java is the first language I have learned. I am good with Java.
              Especially the Java Spring framework. I have made API's, smaller
              applications and webpages in Java.
              <br />
              I have made a webpage for massage booking, using Java Spring, you

              One of my electives is iOS/Android, in which we are using Java for
              Android. So I have experience in building Android apps with Java,
              aswell.

              When i started working with databases, I was firstly introduced to
              SQL, which is the language we learn on KEA, for storing,
              manipulating and retriving data in databases. I have since worked
              with non-relational databases aswell. Overall i got a good
              understanding regarding databases and good skills in the SQL
              language.

            My third elective is Python, which I enjoy a lot. I have found it
            much easier to learn, than when I learned Java (obviously). I have
            also taken an online course in Python. I have made some smaller
            applications and I feel comfortable working with Python, although it
            is still relativly new to me.

            I learned about devops on my third semester. Besides that I have
            messed around with it a lot in my spare time. I have deployed a
            webapplication, using an AWS ec2 instance. You can learn about this
            in "My Projects" <br />
            I have worked a lot with Docker and Jenkins aswell. I feel confident
            in both. I have worked with webhooks using GitHub, Docker and
            Jenkins. I feel comfortable setting up webhooks.
