        <h1 class="text-2xl">First of all. What is node?</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          Simply put Node allows developers to write JavaScript code that will
          run directly in a computer process itself, and not in a browser.
          Therefore we can use node for writing server-side applications.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Installing note: As i am using Linux on my personal computer, i’ll
          tell how to install nodeJS on an ubuntu OS. Firstly I open up the
          terminal to check whether or not node is already installed. To do so i
          would write:
        </p>
        <br />
        <div class="bg-gray-500 rounded py-5 px-5">
          <code> node -v or node --version </code>
        </div>
        <br />
        <p>
          If the return msg is something like v15.8.0, node is already
          installed. If not node we will install node via the snap store
        </p>
        <br />
        <div class="bg-gray-500 rounded py-5 px-5">
          <code>sudo snap install node --classic </code>
        </div>
        <br />
        <p>
          Now I can check for the version once again, and the turnout should
          tell med which node version I’ve got installed at the moment Now that
          node is installed we can make a simple test.js file in vscode and run
          it with node. First i create the test.js which has some simple code in
          it for instance: console.log(“First file run with Node.js”) now in my
          terminal i’ll cd to my project folder and to check if i’m in the right
          place i could type ls and the terminal would return the files from the
          current folder. For this example, it would return “test.js” Now i can
          run my first file by typing
        </p>
        <div class="bg-gray-500 rounded py-5 px-5">
          <code>node test.js </code>
        </div>
        <br />
        <h1 class="text-2xl">Basic Javascript</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          For a long time “Var” declarations was the way to go. But there are
          some issues associated with “Var”. These issues are concerning “Var”s
          scope. Var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped.
          Therefore if we do something like this:
        </p>
        <br />
        <div class="bg-gray-500 rounded py-5 px-5">
          <code
            >var greet = “Hi there” <br />
            var x = 4 if (x > 3) {<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var greet = “Hi there, but different”
            <br />
            } <br />
            console.log(greet) // output will be “Hi there, but different”
          </code>
        </div>
        <br />
        <p>
          as we can see the value will remain as the value declared withing the
          if-statement
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          "let" on the other hand is, as with "const", block-scoped. This means,
          that if you change “var” in the code from last example, to “let” the
          output will be “Hi there”. This is because it’s block scoped, and the
          code will treat the two “let greet” variables as being two different
          variables, one initialized within the blocks of the if statement and
          one initialized in the global scope.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Variables that are declared with “const” will, as the name almost
          states, remain constant. “const” can therefore not be updated, nor
          redeclared. Although if you declare a const object we can change it
          with following example:
        </p>
        <br />
        <div class="bg-gray-500 rounded py-5 px-5">
          <code>
            const greeting = { <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; msg: “Hello there”, <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x : 4 <br />} <br />
            greeting.msg = “Hello there, but different”
          </code>
        </div>
        <br />
        <p>
          “const” must be initialized during declaration. “var” and “let” don't
          have to be. Another difference between var and (let and const) is
          their behaviour when hoisted. Hoisting is JavaScript’s default
          behaviour of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope
          (to the top of the current script or the current function). When
          declared with “let” and “const” the variables are hoisted to the top
          of the block, but NOT initialized. With “var” the variable is hoisted
          to the top of the scope, and initialized with value of undefined.
